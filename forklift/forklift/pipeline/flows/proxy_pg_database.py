def create_proxy_pg_database(database: str, schema: str, database_name_in_dw: str):
    """
    Creates a PostgreSQL engine database in Clickhouse proxying a remote Postgres
    database.

    Data is not physically copied to Clickhouse, this just creates a proxy in
    Clickhouse. This proxy can be queried from Clickhouse as if it were a database in
    Clickhouse, but the query is actually delegated to the original remote Postgres
    instance, and results are streamed back to Clickhouse.

    This allows to query various remote databases easily. Clickhouse also makes it
    possible to join data coming from multiple databases in this way by querying the
    various sources and performing the join in Clickhouse after collecting the data
    from the different sources.

    The performances of queries on these proxyed databases is however that of databases
    which actually execute the queries (plus network overhead), which will be much
    slower than querying data that actually resides in Clickhouse. It is therefore
    recommended to use this mechanism mainly for syncing to tables physically created
    in Clickhouse, and not for user-facing fonctionnality (i.e. dashboards).

    Args:
        database (str): Database to proxy. Possible values : 'monitorfish_remote',
          'monitorenv_remote'
        schema (str): schema to proxy.
        database_name_in_dw (str): Name of the proxy database to create in Clickhouse.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if database credentials for the database are not found in the
          environment
